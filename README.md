# hello-world
This is my first repository.

I am 26. I am a wife and a mother to 3 beautiful children. I have decided to learn to code for 3 main reasons:
1. With three kids, we need a second income to keep them in private school.
2. I do not have a degree or extensive work experience, so I am in need of some marketable skills.
3. I beleive I will be well-suited to this type of work. It also lends well to possibly working from home.

As of 08/01/19, I have been working on FreeCodeCamp's lessons for about a month now. So far it has been only an hour or so in the evenings. But, we have decided I should pursue this more rigorously, and so my husband (who works from home) is taking on more of the housework/childcare to allow me more hours each day. Our goal is that I will be job-ready by Christmas, though still continually learning. At this point, I am not sure if that is a reasonable goal and I will adjust as need-be.
